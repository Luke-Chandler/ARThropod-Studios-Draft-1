        Welcome to my site. As an artistic practitioner in multiple mediums of design, I have had the privilege of working on some amazing art and animation projects. 
        In gaining invaluable experience along the way, I am passionate about exploring numerous innovative forms of design to continuously advance my work. 
        Feel free to explore my portfolio below and contact me with any questions, comments, or requests.

           <dd><img src="images/Carnage Loki.jpg" alt="preview illustration">I generalize in a variety 2D and 3D designs within art and animation. 
               Each new project, either personal or professional starts with a narrative. 
               To me, everything must have story in one way or another for me to realise it visually.</dd>
            <dt><u>My skills</u></dt>
            <dd><img src="images/Fan-art.jpeg" alt="preview illustration">As an artist in general, I started from 2D sketching, and my skills revolved around drawing characters.
                I strengthened these skills throughout my education and branched out during my extended diploma course. 
                This is where I began studying into areas of digital painting, print, editing, 3D design and animation.</dd>
            <dt><u>My 3D work</u></dt>
            <dd><img src="images/Pages.jpg" alt="preview illustration">To me, the process of 3D modelling is essentially similar to sketching. 
                There is no one way of creating something on a piece of 3D software. 
                This applies to characters, environments and objects.
                I use Autodesk Maya and Mudbox to produce all my models, rigs, textures and animations. Please support Autodesk for all their amazing software.</dd>
